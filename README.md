# Smart-Flood-Monitoring-System
Developed a Smart Flood Monitoring System “Flood Monitro”. Flood Monitro is a smart flood monitoring system using Blynk platform as a medium of data transmission. This system is based on two NodeMCU development board integrated using Blynk application (IOS or android). The first NodeMCU is placed at the flood area, whilst the second NodeMCU acts as the control unit. Transmitter unit consisting of first NodeMCU, ultrasonic sensor and flow sensor and the sensor readings are display on the LCD. Then, the data detected from the sensors will be send to the Blynk application via wireless connection. The data are instantly collected and stored in a dedicated database for recording purposes. In order to alert the person in charge of the control unit, the data then will be sent to second NodeMCU via Blynk Bridge to trigger the buzzer and the LED if there exists a chance of causing flood. The GSM is used for transmitting data and as a mode of communication to the concerned individuals of the community, which sends SMS alert whenever there is a flood. Due to its simplicity and availability to the public now-a-days, it is very obvious that information dissemination can be easily achieved. Furthermore, concern agencies, local officials and the local communities could inquire about the current status by sending a message that contains keywords.
